# Conway's Game of Life

# Intro
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton, meaning that it is a simulation of a bunch of cells / tiles with a finite number of states, and a set of rules that govern how the next state should be computed. The set of rules were defined by British Mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
# Rules
Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
